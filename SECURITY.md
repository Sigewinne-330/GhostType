## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for suspected security vulnerabilities.

Use one of these private channels:

1. GitHub Security Advisory (preferred): repository `Security` tab -> `Report a vulnerability`
2. If advisory is unavailable, contact maintainers through private channels listed in repository settings.

## Response SLA

- Initial acknowledgement: within 72 hours
- Triage decision: within 7 days
- Status updates: at least every 7 days until resolution

## Disclosure Policy

- We coordinate a fix before public disclosure.
- Once fixed, we publish release notes with mitigation guidance.
- If secret leakage is involved, keys/tokens must be rotated immediately.
